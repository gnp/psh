0.005 [1999-12-28]
    A very functional release.

  New Evaluation Strategies

    *   brace

    *   fallback_builtin

        Builtins of this type (currently searched in package
        `Psh::Builtins::Fallback') will be executed AFTER no program
        of that name was found. This allows simulation of common
        commands like ls and env on systems not having such
        binaries.

    *   auto_resume

  New Bultins

    *   builtin

    *   env

        On systems with an env binary installed it will use the
        binary, on other systems (namely Win32) it will print a list
        of environment variables.

    *   help

    *   unalias

  Builtin Enhancements

    *   alias

        Changed builtin alias so that '`alias name'' displays the
        alias definition for that name.

    *   bg

        It's now possible to do '`bg commandname'' (e.g. '`bg
        emacs'') fg has the same behaviour for consistency.

    *   cd

        Respects `CDPATH' now and sets `OLDPWD'.

  Portability Enhancements

    *   Added portability infrastructure.

    *   Working Win32 port (though it has limited features).

  Completion Enhancements

    *   Variables for bookmark completion are now
        `@Psh::Completion::bookmarks' and
        `@Psh::Completion::netprograms'.

    *   New Perl Hashkey completion will TAB complete the name of keys
        for Perl hashes (if they are not written in quotes).

    *   Support for user defined completions by
        `%Psh::Completion::custom_completions'.

    *   Perl Symbol completion now supports package names and package
        name completion.

    *   Support for TAB completions for builtins.

    *   A `custom_completions' entry may now also be code. If the value
        of a `custom_completions' key/value pair is a `sub' that
        `sub' will be called and the result used as rules.

    *   A rule for `custom_completions' may now have an optional third
        argument. If that argument is true, the `custom_completion'
        will replace the standard completions instead of adding to
        them.

    *   Filename Completion respects the `FIGNORE' environment variable
        now.

  Other Changes

    *   Documentation updates.

    *   Locales defined for: Default (English), French, German, Italian,
        Portuguese, and Spanish.

    *   New fallback builtins: ls

    *   Prompt evaluation is now more bash compatible and handles even
        more complex prompts.

    *   Replaced `Psh::OS::Unix::glob()' - now uses its own glob routine
        instead of `CORE::glob()' - and is significantly faster
        (important for executable completion).

    *   New variables: `$Psh::Prompt_cont', `$Psh::result_array'.

    *   Moved almost all code from `psh' into `Psh', `Psh::Builtins' and
        `Psh::Util'.

    *   Environment variable `CURRENT_SHELL' is set to the path to psh.

  Bug Fixes

    *   Generation of weekday names.

    *   Small fixes for setenv, print_list and abs_path.

    *   Fixed signal description generation.

0.004 [1999-12-13]
    This release fixes bugs, refactors the code, and adds the
    following features:

    *   Background process management much more like bash.

    *   Perl code in addition to executables may be put in the
        background.

    *   Pipelines.

    *   Initial internationalization.

    *   New built-ins: `alias', `export', `setenv'.

    *   A flexible set of evaluation strategies that can be selected or
        reordered by setting a configuration variable.

    *   Prompt strings can have escapes like `\07' (ASCII `BEL') or
        `\10' (ASCII `LF').

    *   avoided trying to save history if there wasn't even a `ReadLine'
        module.

    *   added `$psh::debugging' variable to hold the debugging state, so
        it can be turned on and off in a running psh.

    *   A `$psh::echo' variable to control whether perl results of
        evaluation are printed.

    *   The `which' builtin now shows which strategy will apply to a
        given command line

    *   Grab more input automatically if `<<BLOCK' appears anywhere on
        the line, or if the line ends with an open brace.

    *   results of `&psh::which()' searches are hashed.

    *   Thorough documentation of every user-accessible variable and
        function

0.003 [1999-11-23]
    Contributions from Markus Peter:

    *   Rudimentary background jobs handling and job management.

    *   Signal handling.

    *   Filename completion.

    *   Updates to history handling.

    *   Flexible `%built_ins' mechanism for adding built-in functions.

    *   Smart mode is on by default.

0.00205 [1999-11-08]
    *   Changed prompting to pass prompt string into `&iget()', which
        passes it on to `&Term::ReadLine::readline()' or prints it
        out if the `ReadLine' module is not available. Thanks to Sam
        Tregar and tmb at lumo.com.

    *   Changed history handling so that empty lines and those
        consisting of entirely whitespace are not recorded.

    *   Fixed a couple of typos.

    *   Changed the regular expression for `smart mode' to allow `vi +3
        psh' in addition to `ls -l'.

    *   Now uses `Getopt::Std' for option processing.

    *   Fixed the code that detects the presence of `Term::ReadLine'.

    *   Made more use of debug mode to print out advisory information.

    *   Use zero instead of `undef' to set `Term::ReadLine::MinLine' so
        that we don't get `undef' usage trouble in the guts of
        `Term::ReadLine::Gnu'.

0.00204 [1999-11-01]
    *   Added a bunch of stuff to the `TODO' file.

    *   Added parens around each part of the `$interactive' detection
        expression.

    *   Prompt variables are now dealt with via `%prompt_vars', which
        can be modified, so that custom prompt variables can be
        created.

    *   Added `%built_ins'.

0.00203 [1999-08-28]
    *   Fixed typo that caused a bug where prompt variable `$' didn't
        work. Thanks to John Labovitz.
