How to make a Perl Shell release:

1999-12-28
Updated 2000-04-30 for Version 0.008


After making all the appropriate changes to psh.pod,
CHANGES.pod, psh.ppd and elsewhere, update $VERSION
in psh and:

    cd psh
    make realclean
    cvs upd -AdP
    cvs commit
    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~
    make
    make test
    make install

Go test it from the home directory and then come back.

Tag the repository, where X is the major version, Y is the
minor version, and Z is the patch level.
	
    cvs -q tag psh-X_YYYZZ

Make the distribution materials:

    make dist
    pod2html CHANGES.pod > CHANGES.html
    cd doc
    pod2html psh.pod > psh.html

Archive the *.tar.gz file, and upload it to SourceForge and
the Focus Research web site. Use the *.html files to provide
on-line documentation and change information.

Announce on SourceForge, CPAN, and Freshmeat.
